FoodBase
========

Description:
---------------
Our idea is to build a application to provide convenience and add more fun for eat-lovers to satisfy their desire for food based on their favorites and restaurants' service. Users can create their own accounts and update their personal information like their gender, vegetarian status, diet status and location. Also, this is an eaters' networking place, so users can search and add friends so that they can share information and hang out. We will get information of restaurants from websites like yelp including location, category, link to website, phone number, open hours, etc. Users can add restaurants to their "visited place" list with their own rating, spent cost. If there are some restaurants the user want to try but haven't been there yet, the user can bookmark it. Every time the user want to find a place to eat, the application will automatically create a ordered list of recommendations based on the user's "visited place" list (food type, price range) and bookmarked places and locations. Also, the user can just ignore the recommendations and search for restaurants according to their own specifications. One more feature is providing a social networking platform on which the user can invite friends to eat together and even publicize the event to allow others join.

Usefulness:
---------------
Eating is very important to everyone. Many people will occasionally have no idea what to eat. Our data will collect many information about food and resturant. The users will get sugguestions about what resturants fit the users' requirement best. The users are mainly campus students and local citizens. Our data will display different information about the resturants to users such as price, location, telephone number, food style. The user can select based on their requirements. The users can also quickly find any related information of some specific resturants. Since our data contains many resturants, the local resturants may be willing to provide new information about their resturants to attract guests so that our data will be detailed and up-to-date. Therefore our data can be used as an advertisement.

Realness:

We allow updated users and restaurants information stored in our database. And we make recommendations and social functions as a plus compared with other existing apps.
